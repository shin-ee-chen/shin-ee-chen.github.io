I’m Xinyi Chen, an [ELLIS](https://ellis.eu/) PhD student jointly supervised by [Maarten de Rijke](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/bio/) at the University of Amsterdam and [Anders Søgaard](https://anderssoegaard.github.io/) at the University of Copenhagen. My research investigates how cognitive principles can inform the development of large language models. I am particularly interested in how multi-agent systems can collaborate to solve complex tasks, inspired by human learning, reasoning, and problem-solving strategies. Beyond this, my work also spans multimodal representation learning (vision + language) and the evaluation and benchmarking of large language models.


**I’m looking for internships during Summer 2026—send me a message if you have any opportunities to share!**
