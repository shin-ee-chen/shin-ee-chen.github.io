I’m Xinyi Chen, a PhD student at the [IRLab](https://irlab.science.uva.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam, supervised by [Maarten de Rijke](https://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/m.derijke/bio/). My research focuses on leveraging cognitive-inspired methods to better understand and enhance large language models. Currently, I am exploring how multi-agent systems can collaborate to tackle complex tasks, drawing inspiration from human learning, reasoning, and problem-solving processes. Additionally, my work spans multi-modal models (integrating vision and text) and benchmarking large language models.

I’m looking for internships during Summer 2025—send me a message if you have any opportunities to share!
