title: "The BLA benchmark: Investigating basic language abilities of pre-trained multimodal models"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-12-06-bla
excerpt: 'BLA is a novel, automatically constructed benchmark to evaluate vision-and-language models on Basic Language Abilities. In the BLA tasks, we explore to what extent the models handle basic linguistic constructions—active-passive voice, coordination, and relative clauses—that even preschool children can typically master.
